#### E*TRADE PRO

The E\*TRADE PRO (Australia) product was developed as the white-label license of ActiveTrader - a internet-based professional trading platform (market data, EMS). This offering dates back to 1999, when online trading was in it's infancy. E\*TRADE PRO focused on professional traders (advisers and prop traders) with more advanced execution needs.
