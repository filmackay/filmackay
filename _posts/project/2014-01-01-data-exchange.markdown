#### Data Marketplace

DatumEx is a service to create a data marketplace for data owners to store, analyse, and monetise value. Currently in development, it is designed to be a cloud based service requiring no dedicated infrastructure.

Designed to meet a unique mix of simplicity and power, DatumEx is based on an immutable, hierarchical, column-oriented data store. Taking inspiration from LINQ, Numpy, Pandas, Spark - it is designed to be a general purpose numerical analytics platform.
