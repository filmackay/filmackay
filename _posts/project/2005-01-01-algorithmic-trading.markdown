#### Algo Trading

This project involved the development of a series of quantitative trading systems - using a number of different techniques. From conception, back-testing, through to implementation this involved analysis of a number of different asset classes (equity futures, cash equities, FX), timeframes (1 minute, daily), and geography (US, Europe, Australia).

Quantitative objectives and techniques included:

* Outlier identification
* Kalman Filters
* Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD)
